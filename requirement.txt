Context
This is an event log of an incident management process extracted from data gathered from the audit system of an instance of the ServiceNowTM platform used by an IT company.

Content
The event log is enriched with data loaded from a relational database underlying a corresponding process-aware information system. Information was anonymized for privacy.

Number of instances: 141,712 events (24,918 incidents)
Number of attributes: 36 attributes (1 case identifier, 1 state identifier, 32 descriptive attributes, 2 dependent variables)

The attributed closedat is used to determine the dependent variable for the time completion prediction task. The attribute resolvedat is highly correlated with closed_a. In this event log, some rows may have the same values (they are equal) since not all attributes involved in the real-world process are present in the log.

Attributes used to record textual information are not placed in this log. The missing values should be considered unknown information.

Thanks to University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil for this amazing dataset.

Inspiration
Create a Machine learning application which predicts the estimated time and date for the final closure of a opened ticket based on the given attributes.
